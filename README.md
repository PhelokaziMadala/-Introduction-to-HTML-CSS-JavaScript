**üåêüß±Module: Foundations of HTML for Front-End Development**
In this module, I explored HTML (HyperText Markup Language)‚Äîthe cornerstone of front-end development. I learned about the history and core objectives of HTML and how its features contribute to building flexible and interactive websites.

A key focus was understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) and how it connects HTML structure with scripting for dynamic user experiences. I also examined when to use HTML vs. XML, deepening my understanding of web markup strategies.

Through practical exercises using labs, I gained hands-on experience integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I discovered how HTML leverages APIs to extend interactivity and functionality within web applications.

**üé®üß©Module 2: Building Interactive Webpages with HTML5 & CSS**
In this module, I developed a deeper understanding of how HTML5 and CSS work together to create visually appealing and well-structured websites. HTML5 introduces semantic elements like header, footer, section, and article, which enable developers to divide and define content more clearly and meaningfully.

I learned how HTML5 input types‚Äîincluding dates, emails, times, and numbers‚Äîenhance user interactivity by streamlining data entry and validation within forms. These features are widely supported across modern browsers, enabling consistent user experiences.

Alongside HTML, I explored CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)‚Äîthe language that brings design to life. I learned how to apply styling rules to HTML elements and how CSS influences layout, color, typography, and responsiveness.

The module also introduced CSS frameworks, outlining their advantages‚Äîsuch as faster development and consistency‚Äîand disadvantages, like reduced flexibility. Understanding different frameworks gave me insights into selecting the right tools for different project needs.

Mastering the synergy between HTML5‚Äôs structure and CSS‚Äôs style has prepared me to craft rich, interactive web applications with both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

**‚ú®üíªModule3: Enhancing User Experience with JavaScript**
In this module, I explored how JavaScript breathes life into static web pages, enabling dynamic interactions and seamless user experiences. Building upon a foundation of HTML and CSS, I learned how to add engaging functionality such as interactive forms, responsive menus, and animated slideshows.

I started with the fundamentals of JavaScript syntax, learning how to declare and manipulate variables, control application logic with conditional and loop statements, and build custom objects and functions‚Äîthe building blocks of any modern JavaScript application.

I also gained hands-on experience working with the Document Object Model (DOM), identifying common DOM objects and using JavaScript to access and modify page content dynamically. I practiced modifying inline styles and attributes, which gave me full control over how web elements appear and respond in real time.

The module introduced me to JavaScript APIs, expanding the possibilities of what can be achieved in the browser. I now understand how client-side JavaScript works in harmony with HTML and CSS to build powerful, interactive front-end applications.

By mastering JavaScript‚Äôs core concepts and its integration with the DOM, I can now elevate user interfaces with dynamic behavior and interactivity that truly enhances the web experience.

**üßë‚ÄçüíºüíªModule 4: Final Project ‚Äì Building a Client Portfolio Website **
In this final module, I applied my front-end development skills to build a single-page portfolio web application for a client of ABC Consultant‚Äîa firm dedicated to helping early-career professionals secure industry placements.

This hands-on project involved:

Editing and correcting HTML to ensure proper structure and semantic accuracy.
